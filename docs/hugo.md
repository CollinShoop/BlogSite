# [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

> Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

I was inspired by FireShip's recent video [Hugo in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RKpf3rK57I&ab_channel=Fireship)
and wanted to give it a try for myself. Static content sounds perfect for my needs and I wanted to 
see for myself how nice (or not so nice) Hugo is to use (at least for casual content).

In the past, I would have gone with something more powerful like [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). In my experience, Vue.js
requires a good amount of custom styling to look nice that I honestly don't want to deal with that more than absolutely necessary. 
It's much more convenient to fork a nice looking Hugo theme like [hello-friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend).
