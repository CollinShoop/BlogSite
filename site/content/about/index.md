Hey ðŸ‘‹ As the website name might suggest, my name is Collin Shoop. 

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at Google where I contribute to 
[Distributed Cloud Edge](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/hybrid-cloud/announcing-google-distributed-cloud-edge-and-hosted). 

Currently, my focus is on learning more about security & networking and pushing myself to become a better leader 
and team member.
