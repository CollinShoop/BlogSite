Hey ðŸ‘‹ As the website name might suggest, my name is Collin Shoop. 

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at Google where I contribute to [Distributed Cloud Edge](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/hybrid-cloud/announcing-google-distributed-cloud-edge-and-hosted). Currently, my focus is on learning more about security & networking and pushing myself to become a better leader and team member.
